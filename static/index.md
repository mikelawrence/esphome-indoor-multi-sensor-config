# Initial Programming

You need to make two choices before programming the ESPHome Indoor Multi-Sensor. 

First is the Sensor package. You can either choose Package A, the Sensirion SEN6X sensor package which is an all-in-one sensor package. Or you can choose Package B which is a lower cost discrete sensor set that is missing particulate matter sensors. 

Next up is what type of radar sensor you plan on including. There are 4 options here, Hi Link LD2410 (My favorite), DFRobot C4001 (SEN0609 and SEN0610) Hi-Link LD2450, Hi-Link LD2410S and Hi-Link LD2420.

Each of these these builds include all supported sensors: pressure, light, sound level, power/energy monitor and speaker. If there are sensors you wish to not include, take control of the sensor and start configuring.

If you are really new to ESPHome I would recommend searching on Youtube for getting started videos.

# Web Installation

Use the buttons below to install pre-built firmware directly to your device via USB. You must use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to program your device. Firefox does not work.
